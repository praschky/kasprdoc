Our few-hourly (e.g. 1h, 3h, 6h) regional (national, adm1, or adm2 accordingly) level products provide an aggregated measure of region’s ICT Infrastructure, via millions of individual internet protocol (IP v4) address observations. The product provides the time-varying availability and quality of a region’s infrastructure aggregated across the geographic space of the region. As such, the sampling design intentionally emphasises diversity in geographic units rather than conducting a representative sample of all IP addresses from the region detached from geo-location. 2.1 Sampling Design To provide a product of global scale and frequency, a random sampling methodology is necessary within some geographic boundaries due to a very high concentration of IP addresses allocated there, e.g. districts of major cities. In these, often small sub-urban geographic boundaries, a randomised sample of 100,000 IPs is drawn to measure a diversity of unique physical locations within the boundary. Where the internet address concentration is lower, we conduct a census measurement design, i.e. measuring the activity and quality of every address assigned to be in that geographic region. Assignment of IP v4 blocks to regions is conducted monthly by a third-party. Subscribers to KASPR Datahaus products who wish to know more about geo-spatial assignment can inquire with the provider directly. To emphasise, the priority of the few-hourly Global ICT Intel product is to provide a consistent, scientific sampling methodology across tens of thousands of small geographic boundaries world-wide, such that at the regional level aggregate, significant shocks and time-varying activity patterns across the entire geographic domain of the region are incorporated. 2.2 Global ICT Intel Data - Variables The two Global ICT Intel measures are defined as follows: number_unique_active_ips_in_sample: The sum of all unique active IP addresses in the region based on our sampling and census methodology (described above), where active means that the IP was online at least once in the sampling period. The measure only covers IP addresses in the IPv4 (IP version 4) space. This measure also serves as the unique IP sample size for the rtt measures, described below. rtt_X_norm: These are proxy measures for the temporal quality of the ICT infrastructure in a region. They are based on the ping response time (in ms) which measures the round-trip time (`rtt’) for a small data package sent from our scanning platforms to each individual IP address. To account for IP-specific noise, in a first step, the average rtt (rtt’) over all rtt measurements of a single IP is calculated. Then, in a second step, the average and variance of these normalised rtt values are used to form the two quality measures. In this way, focus is given to the typical IP latency of the parcel of IPs in the geographic region, and the between IP variance arising from differences in the quality of ICT infrastructure across IPs, rather than idiosyncratic properties of a particular IP in either measure. rtt_mean_norm is the average ping response time of all online IP addresses sampled in an region over the period. (i.e. mean(rtt’)) rtt_var_norm is the variance of ping response times of all online IP addresses in a region over the period. (i.e. var(rtt’)) The variable day_indicator indicates when our scanning and aggregation technology crosses over from one scanning phase to the next (approximately around the 8-10th of a new month). It takes the value of 1 for most days and the value of 2 if it is a cross-over day. The impact is normally negligible during the cross-over days. The main variable impacted would be number_unique_active_ips_in_sample. In our own back-testing, no model selected this feature as important, confirming that the cross-over is not informationally relevant. 2.3 Timing Definitions Values of Unix timestamp *time_e and corresponding time string time_e_utc_str indicate the start of the period for which the measurements pertain. For example, for our 3-hourly products, a timestamp corresponding to 12:00:00.000 indicates measurements taken between 12:00:00.000 and 14:59:59.999. For ease of use, we also provide three additional variables, timezone_offset, timezone_name, and time_local which provide the region’s offset (from UTC in hours), IANA timezone name, and the adjusted time equivalent to the UTC time with local offset applied. Note: if the larger region (e.g. national) has more than one timezone within it (e.g. at adm1 level), the most frequent timezone across the lower geographic zones is applied to the larger region. 2.4 Data Fields "],["suggested-use.html", "3 Suggested Use", " 3 Suggested Use Due to differences in the setup of the physical backbone of each region’s ICT infrastructure, comparing the raw levels of our measures between regions (between variation) is not advised. The value of the Global ICT Intel product comes from the hourly and daily, time-varying signal at the given regional-level ( within variation). As such it is ideally suited to be combined with other time-series (e.g. few-hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) data from the respective region. If a comparison of changes in ICT infrastructure between geographic regions is desired, a good approach would be to simply build the first differences of our measures at the regional level and compare, or, to use the pre-prepared index values as given. Given the high-frequency of the Global ICT Intel product, it is well suited to detect shocks to a region’s ICT infrastructure. These shocks can include electricity outages, political events, violent conflict, natural disasters, or sovereign suppression activities. "],["disclaimer.html", "4 Disclaimer 4.1 Background Intellectual Property", " 4 Disclaimer KDH Global ICT Intel Data is constructed from remote measurements based on the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request routine. As any remote measurement technology, KDH Global ICT Intel Data can only be an approximation of the local internet infrastructure and human experience of the internet on the ground. It is important to note that: Our measurements only cover IP addresses in the IPv4 (IP version 4) space. Any IP addresses that are not reachable by ICMP echo requests, are not included in our measurements. 3.The geolocation information for each of the individual IP addresses is based on data from Third Party providers and are updated on a monthly basis. The level of accuracy of the IP geolocation can vary across geographies and time and this can affect the accuracy of the KDH Global ICT Intel Data products. KASPR Datahaus PTY LTD makes no additional or express or implied warranties related to the accuracy of this location data across space and time. Furthermore, KDH data acquisition and data service provision relies on an assumed wider operating environment beyond the control or authority of KDH. Failure or interruption in any aspect of this operating environment can render KDH unable to acquire or provide data to clients in a timely manner, or at all. Assumed features of the operating environment include, but are not limited to: A functioning global internet layer, allowing the free flow of information packets, especially ICMP echo requests, across all networks and jurisdictions; Network neutrality such that KDH packets are managed in the internet layer in an equally expeditious manner to any other packet on the network; A fully functional and operational commercial cloud infrastructure network, allowing remote server operation, interaction, data transmission between remote servers and storage locations, query at rest functions, and programmatic interaction and job activitation; and A functioning remote authentication service and delivery mechanism to the client for final data transfer.

In order to ensure that Licensee meets the requirements, Licensee shall: At the instruction and request of Licensor, purge any and all KDH Data (but not any Input) in its possession or stored on any device, service or system, including any back-up copies, in accordance with KDH’s data purge instructions and mechanism, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions imposed on Licensee to retain such content; Allow Licensor access to the Licensee’s infrastructure in order to ensure the destruction of all KDH Data; Collaborate with Licensor in order to ensure that all KDH Data is returned or destroyed in accordance with KDH’s instruction and data purge mechanism, including but not limited to providing written certification from a director of Licensee that Licensee has complied with this clause. This section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. 5.10 GENERAL Force Majeure. Licensor will not be in breach of its contractual obligations in case of delay in performing, or failure to perform, its obligations under the Agreement to the extent such delay or failure is caused by the occurrence of any contingency beyond the reasonable control, and without any fault, of such Party, which contingencies include but are not limited to acts of God, pandemics, epidemics, war, riot, power failures, internet disruption, fires, and floods (Force Majeure Event). For the avoidance of doubt, KDH measurement, aggregation, analysis and data delivery operation is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. Failure or interruption in any aspect of this AWS infrastructure also constitutes a Force Majeur Event because it is beyond reasonable control of Licensor. In any such event, the time limits for performance will be extended for a period of time equivalent to the time lost due to the Force Majeure Event. In order to avail itself of the relief provided in this Section 10.1., the affected Party shall act with due diligence to remedy the cause of, or to mitigate or overcome, such delay or failure. Assignment Licensee shall not be entitled to assign any of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Licensor.
