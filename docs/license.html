<div id="general" class="section level2" number="5.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.10</span> GENERAL</h2>
<p><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Licensor will not be in breach of its contractual obligations in case of delay in performing, or failure to perform, its obligations under the Agreement to the extent such delay or failure is caused by the occurrence of any contingency beyond the reasonable control, and without any fault, of such Party, which contingencies include but are not limited to acts of God, pandemics, epidemics, war, riot, power failures, internet disruption, fires, and floods (Force Majeure Event). For the avoidance of doubt, KDH measurement, aggregation, analysis and data delivery operation is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. Failure or interruption in any aspect of this AWS infrastructure also constitutes a Force Majeur Event because it is beyond reasonable control of Licensor. In any such event, the time limits for performance will be extended for a period of time equivalent to the time lost due to the Force Majeure Event. In order to avail itself of the relief provided in this Section 10.1., the affected Party shall act with due diligence to remedy the cause of, or to mitigate or overcome, such delay or failure.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong> Licensee shall not be entitled to assign any of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Licensor.</p>
<p><strong>No Partnership, Joint Venture or Agency.</strong> The Agreement does not constitute either Party the agent of the other, or create a partnership, joint venture or similar relationship between the Parties, and no Party shall have the power to obligate or bind the other Party in any manner whatsoever (including the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power). The Parties shall act in all respects as independent contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Notices.</strong> Any notice hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given: (i) 7 days after the date of mailing if sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested; (ii) when delivered if delivered personally or sent by express courier service;; or (iii) when transmitted via email, provided that the receiving Party acknowledges receipt by return email, and that the email clearly states in the subject line that it is intended to give notice hereunder. Any notice hereunder shall be sent to a Party at its address set forth in the first page of this Licence, and either Party may change such address by notice to the other Party.</p>
<p><strong>Enforceability.</strong> Should any clause of the Agreement be found to be invalid or unenforceable, such clause (or part thereof) shall be deemed severed from the Agreement and the other clauses hereof shall remain in full force and effect as if the Agreement had been executed without the offending clause appearing. In such a case, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith and on a commercially reasonable efforts basis to agree alternative or amended valid, legal and enforceable clauses with the same economic effect as intended by the Parties hereto.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Rights.</strong> No provision of the Agreement is intended to create any rights in favour of any third party who is not a Party.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> The Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any other prior oral or written agreement regarding the subject matter hereof.</p>
<p><strong>Amendment.</strong> The Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument duly signed by the Parties.</p>
